                              <p>Most people prefer you call them by their first name. When was the last time someone instructed you to call them by their last name?

                                So what's the big deal?

                                Well, it's really not a show stopper, and there is minimal risk you'll offend someone if you do call them by their first name; however, when you call someone by their last name you are showing them respect. In essence you are saying to them, I respect you and you are important.

                                Do you like to feel respected and important?

                                Again, it's a little thing, but in a world where there is too little respect going around, it will make you stand out from other competing candidates for this same position. <br>
                              Throughout your interview, hiring managers will be trying to assess how easy you will be to work with and manage. It's true, employers need self starters and leaders, but sometimes they simply need you to be a good soldier and do your job.</p>

                                  <h6>3. Look people in the eye...and smile</h6>
                                  <p>Body language is an extremely important detail of proper job interview etiquette.

                                    Communication experts tell us that 80% of our communication with others is non-verbal.

                                    One of the best ways to connect with people and build trust is to look them in the eye. Eye contact is also important during a group interview.

                                    Throughout my executive recruiting career, I've occasionally had candidates arrive at an employer thinking they were going to be in a one-on-one interview setting, only to be ushered into a conference room with 4 to 5 hiring authorities asking them questions one after the other.

                                    Most people when they're under pressure, don't smile, and appear nervous and lacking in confidence. It's amazing how something as simple as a smile can project confidence and leadership...even if you're a nervous wreck.

                                  Have you ever heard someone say, I didn't trust that guy. He didn't look me in the eye?! Your eyes are the windows to your soul and often convey to others that you are trustworthy and real.</p>

                                      <p>This is another non-verbal way to connect with people.

                                        It seems ludicrous to be judged negatively by a limp handshake, but people do it all the time.

                                        Even so, be careful with this advice.

                                        You don't want your handshake to be too firm--especially if a man is shaking hands with a woman.

                                        There is this guy at my church who practically breaks my hand every time we shake hands.

                                      I actually try to avoid "The Bone Crusher" on Sunday. He's a great guy, but sheesh, take it easy!</p>

                                      <h6>5. Let the company take the lead during your interview</h6>
                                      <p>Sometimes when your interviewer is soft spoken or laid back you may feel the urge to keep things moving. So, you start taking back some control and the next thing you know, you're rambling.

                                        Resist this. Let the employer run the show.

                                        If there are periods of silence...just sit there in the silence. If you are well prepared for your interview, relax, you have nothing to worry about.

                                      One of the most common interviewing mistakes is talking too much. It's easy to ramble and over explain things if your interview is a person of few words and there are periods of silence. Resist this and simply let them set the pace of the interview.</p>

                                          <strong>6. Don't step on the last 3 words of someone's conversation</strong>
                                          <p>I've noticed a disturbing trend these days.

                                            When I'm talking with someone, often times they will step on the last 2-3 words of my sentence and talk over me without extending to me the courtesy of finishing my sentence.

                                            Has this ever happened to you? Annoying, isn't it?

                                            Reporters and TV talk show hosts do it all the time. It is especially prevalent among Type A personalities.

                                          Let your interviewer finish making their point, pause for 1-2 seconds; then, respond to their question or add to the conversation.</p>

                                            These days, there's no excuse for job seekers not to do a little bit of research," Marinelli says. "The last thing employers want to see is that someone just wants a job and it doesn't matter to them that they're interviewing with us.

                                        <ul>
                                          <li>
                                            Nothing reveals a bad attitude like excessively criticizing your current or previous employers. Your interviewer will instantly wonder whether you'd talk about her and her company that way if she hired you.
                                          </li>
                                          <li>
                                            Using a friendly tone is nice, but it's important not to cross a line by sharing too much personal information.
                                          </li>
                                          <li>
                                            Remember, you never know how the person sitting across from you will react to a story about your weekend antics.
                                          </li>
                                          <li>
                                            You only get limited time with the interviewer, so stay focused on your professional accomplishments and the company's needs.
                                          </li>
                                          <li>
                                            Experts agree: Job candidates should never bring up the topic of salary first, because it puts them in a weaker negotiation position. 
                                          </li>
                                          <li>
                                            Additionally, talking about it too early may give the impression that you're only interested in the job for its perks. So save this conversation for after you've been offered the job.
                                          </li>
                                          <li>
                                            Communication goes beyond words. It's important to make eye contact while listening and speaking.
                                          </li>
                                          <li>
                                            However, you should be prepared to talk about your salary expectations in case the interviewer raises the topic. See more advice about salary negotiations.

                                          <li>
                                            This is not the time to be humble. Don't assume the interviewer will remember every detail from your resume about the awards you've won or the sales goals you've exceeded. 
                                          </li>
                                          <li>
                                           Women are especially prone to deflecting credit for their accomplishments and should practice explaining their qualifications and describing their talents.
                                         </li>
                                         <li>
                                          On the other hand, it's a mistake to come on too strong. Don't brag to the point of arrogance, and don't try to dominate the conversation.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                          "Some people, many in sales or marketing or who have stronger personalities, they will tend to take over the interview. They're controlling the situation too much," Cole says. "You want to vet the interviewer, but you can't give even a hint that you're doing so, because you'll come across as an overbearing control freak."
                                        </li> 
                                        <li>
                                          From an employer's perspective, the purpose of a job interview is to determine whether a candidate is a good match for the company's needs.
